      "title": "❓ Frequently Asked Questions About Casino Bonuses",
      "q1": {
        "question": "How does an online casino bonus work?",
        "answer": "A casino bonus is a promotional offer that increases your initial deposit. For example, with a 200% bonus, if you deposit €100, you'll receive an additional €200, totaling €300 to play with. The bonus is subject to wagering requirements that you must meet before withdrawing your winnings."
      },
      "q2": {
        "question": "What is the best bonus percentage in 2025?",
        "answer": "The best bonuses range from 300% to 400% of your deposit. However, always check the wagering conditions. A 150% bonus with x30 wager can be more advantageous than a 400% bonus with x60 wager. Our comparator helps you identify the best real offers."
      },
      "q3": {
        "question": "What is a no wager bonus?",
        "answer": "A no wager bonus (or no wagering requirement) means you can withdraw your winnings immediately without having to wager a certain amount. It's the most transparent and advantageous type of bonus. The initial bonus is usually deducted upon withdrawal, but all your winnings remain yours."
      },
      "q4": {
        "question": "What payment methods are accepted at online casinos?",
        "answer": "Modern casinos accept: bank cards (Visa, Mastercard), bank transfers, cryptocurrencies (Bitcoin, Ethereum, USDT), e-wallets (Skrill, Neteller, MiFinity), and prepaid cards (Paysafecard, Neosurf, Cashlib). Deposits are instant, withdrawals generally take between 24h and 72h."
      },
      "q5": {
        "question": "Are online casinos safe and legal?",
        "answer": "Yes, all casinos listed on GigaBonus have official licenses (Curaçao, MGA, UKGC) and use 256-bit SSL encryption. Games are RNG (Random Number Generator) certified and audited by independent organizations (eCOGRA, iTech Labs). Your funds and personal data are 100% protected."
      },
      "q6": {
        "question": "How long to receive my winnings?",
        "answer": "Timeframes vary by method: cryptocurrencies (instant to 12h), bank cards (24-48h), transfers (2-5 days). After your first KYC verification, subsequent withdrawals are generally processed within 24h. Crypto casinos offer the fastest withdrawals."

      "title": "Frequently Asked Questions",
      "q1": {
        "question": "How to choose the best casino for {guideName}?",
        "answer": "The optimal choice depends on your personal priorities. If you prioritize bonuses: compare welcome packages by calculating the bonus/wager ratio (the lower, the better). For fast withdrawals: favor casinos accepting crypto or e-wallets with times less than 24h. For security: verify the presence of a valid license (Curaçao, MGA), independent audits (eCOGRA, iTech Labs), and SSL 256-bit encryption protocols. For game diversity: ensure a catalog of 3000+ titles with your favorite providers (Pragmatic, NetEnt, Evolution). Our comparison table synthesizes these criteria to facilitate your decision. Always test with a small initial deposit (€20-50) before committing larger amounts."
      },
      "q2": {
        "question": "Do {guideName} bonuses have hidden conditions?",
        "answer": "Serious casinos display all conditions in their terms and conditions accessible from the bonus page. Beware of common pitfalls: excessive wager (over 50x), maximum bet limit during wager (often €5/spin), excluded games or reduced contribution (progressive jackpots generally contribute 0-10%), short validity period (< 14 days), and maximum win cap after bonus conversion (e.g. 10x the bonus). All casinos in our selection have been verified: no abusive conditions, clear terms in French, and transparent customer support. Our advice: ALWAYS read the T&Cs before claiming a bonus, and don't hesitate to contact support if in doubt."
      },
      "q3": {
        "question": "Can you play responsibly on these casinos?",
        "answer": "Absolutely, and it's even a priority. All recommended casinos offer responsible gaming tools: customizable daily/weekly/monthly deposit limits, playing time limits with automatic alerts, temporary (24h to 6 months) or permanent self-exclusion, self-assessment test to detect risky behaviors, and links to help organizations (Joueurs Info Service 09 74 75 13 13, Adictel). Casinos licensed in Curaçao are required to respect these standards under penalty of license suspension. Our recommendation: ALWAYS set yourself a monthly budget not to exceed (max 5% of your income), NEVER play with borrowed money, consider deposits as entertainment (not an investment), and take regular breaks (15min stop every hour)."
      },
      "q4": {
        "question": "How much can you win on these casinos?",
        "answer": "Potential winnings vary enormously depending on the type of game: progressive jackpot slots can reach several million euros (Mega Moolah: records over €15M), classic slots generally offer x1000 to x50,000 the bet (Dead or Alive 2: max x100,000), and live casino offers more moderate but more frequent winnings (roulette: max x35 on single number, blackjack: 3:2 payout on natural 21). The average RTP (Return to Player) of listed casinos is 96-97%, which means that on average, the casino returns 96-97% of bets in winnings. Warning: this is statistical over millions of spins, not an individual guarantee. The biggest verified winnings from our readers on these casinos: €45,000 on Gates of Olympus, €18,500 on Crazy Time, €12,300 on Lightning Roulette, and €8,900 on Sweet Bonanza. Key to success: strict bankroll management, choice of games with high RTP (>96.5%), and patience (don't chase losses)."
